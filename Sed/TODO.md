# To-Do List

This is the To-Do List for the Sed project:

- Make changes so I can test the algorithms with multiline strings
  (rather than files).
- Provide a way to read from STDIN so it will really work as a filter
  like `sed`.
- Handle the desire/need to delete lines. Currently you can return
  `""` when you want to delete a line, but that leaves a blank line
  in the output stream.
