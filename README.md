# ScalaSed

This project contains two sub-projects:

- The _Sed_ project provides Unix/Linux `sed`-like capabilities
  (I don’t want to overstate it, it’s just a very early first draft
  that’s useful to me)
- The _SedDemo_ provides demonstrates how to use _Sed_

If this is your first time here you’ll probably want to look at
the SedDemo project first to see examples of how to use Sed.

I used to have more documentation here, but I’ve found that it’s
easier to just keep the documentation in the subprojects, so please
see the _Sed_ and _SedDemo_ subprojects for more information.
