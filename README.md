# ScalaSed

This is a little combination of projects:

- The _Sed_ project provides Unix/Linux `sed`-like capabilities
- The _SedDemo_ provides demonstrates how to use `Sed`

See the SedDemo project for examples of how to use `Sed`.



## Brief introduction

As a very brief introduction, there are currently two
different versions of Sed:

- `Sed` lets you operate on one line at a time
- `MultilineSed` currently lets you merge/coalesce two lines
  into one, such as when you want to convert this:

````
Hello
-----
````

into this:

````
<h2>Hello</h2>
````

This is a first, barely-tested release of this code, so it
surely has bugs.
